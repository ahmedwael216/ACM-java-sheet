# Contribution Guide
> this project is under development and is in it's very early stages.
## Structural Hierarchy:
1. Topics will be divided to diffrent folders.
2. In each Folder 1 or more java files will contain the Algorithms.
3. Algorithms that are communly used together should be in 1 java file with each other.
***
## File Structure:
- Methods & Variables should have ***meaningful names***.
- No names like (c1, c2 ,flag  ...) without explaining what do they represent.
- Add comments to explain hard to understand or easily forgetable parts.
- please add a comment before every method telling what is it's time complexity in [Big O](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) notation. 
***
